# Chess Openings Library CLI Functional Specification
The openings CLI app provides users with a simple, command-line interface to store and recall chess openings. 

## User Stories

### Basic Operations
- As a user, I want to store an opening, so I can recall it later.
- As a user, I want to recall an opening, so I can better remember and put it to use.

### Continuous Operations

### Functional Requirements

- The app must prompt the user for the name, color, and move order of the opening.
- The app must provide positive feedback after input and allow continued use.
