#CLI Project - Chess Openings Library

This program acts as a library for storing and recalling chess openings. Users input the name, which side plays it, and the order of moves. Users may also print a list of the all the openings they've inputted or grab a specific opening they know the name of. 
Interfacing with the program is easy. After running, it will display a numbered list of options. The user types the number of which option they'd like. When inputting a new opening each data point will be inputted one at a time.
